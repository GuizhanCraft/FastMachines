# FastMachines

[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh_CN.md)

This Slimefun addon extracts the manual machines from FinalTECH and made some changes to put them into a separate addon.  
Fast machines are manual crafters that cost energy to run and can craft items with all shapeless recipes and support bulk crafting.
